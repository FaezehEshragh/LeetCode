Java has a LinkedList class, and it is different from the ArrayList class. Both are part of the Java Collections Framework, but they have distinct implementations and performance characteristics suited to different use cases.

LinkedList
Implementation: LinkedList is implemented as a doubly linked list. Each element (node) contains references (pointers) to the previous and next elements in the list.
Performance:
Insertion and Deletion: LinkedList provides efficient insertion and deletion operations, especially at the beginning or end of the list (O(1) time complexity for these operations).
Access Time: Accessing an element by index takes O(n) time on average because it requires traversal from the start or end of the list to the specified index.
Memory Usage: Each element in a LinkedList requires additional memory for storing the references to the previous and next nodes.
ArrayList
Implementation: ArrayList is implemented as a resizable array. It maintains an internal array where the elements are stored.
Performance:
Insertion and Deletion: ArrayList provides efficient random access (O(1) time complexity for accessing elements by index). However, insertion and deletion operations can be costly, especially if they involve shifting elements (e.g., inserting or deleting at the beginning or middle of the list).
Resizing: When the internal array runs out of space, ArrayList must resize (usually doubling the size), which involves copying the elements to a new array. This resizing operation has O(n) time complexity.
Memory Usage: ArrayList uses contiguous memory for storing elements, which can be more memory-efficient than LinkedList for large lists, but it may also allocate more space than needed due to its resizing strategy.
When to Use Which
Use LinkedList:
When you need efficient insertions and deletions, particularly at the beginning or end of the list.
When the number of elements is frequently changing and you want to avoid the overhead of array resizing.
Use ArrayList:
When you need fast random access to elements by index.
When the list is relatively stable in size, meaning insertions and deletions are infrequent or mostly occur at the end.
